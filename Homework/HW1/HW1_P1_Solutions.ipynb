    "version (`Series(*Rs)`) the tuple with be of length `len(Rs)` larger than 1, and contain numbers, while in the first version (`Series([1,2,3])`) it will be of length 1, and that first element will be a list or a tuple. We thus need an `if` statement to sort out what we got. The safest would be to test `Rs[0]` for the type. If it is a number, then use the `Rs` as the list, if not, use `Rs[0]` as the list. The safest way to test if `Rs[0]` is a number is `isinstance(Rs[0],numbers.Number)`."
