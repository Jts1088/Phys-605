# This is a test code is intended to readout a set of 3 SN74HC165 chips
# connected to two SN74HC4040 counters, for a 24-bit serial readout counter.
# The counter input should be gated using a NAND gate to a GPIO pin.
#
# Author: Maurik Holtrop
#
# Basic operation:
#  1) Setup the GPIO input and output ports.
#  2) Send a counter clear signal on the Counter_Clear pin.
#  3) Open the AND (or NAND) gate to the counter clock. (See notes)
#  4) Wait, or run code to be timed.
#  5) Close the AND gate.
#  6) Send a Load signal to the SN74HC165 chip on Serial_Load.
#  7) Readout the SN74HC165 for Serial_N clocks on Serial_CLK by loading the
#     bits from the Serial_In.
#  8) Print the resulting number to the screen.
#
# Notes:
#     * When using the SN74HC193 chip for counting, you can gate by
#       sending the Counter_Gate signal to the "down" clock, and the Clock
#       to be counted to the "up" clock.
#     * When using the SN74HC4040 chip, add a NAND gate to the CLK input.
#       One input of the NAND gate goes to the Counter_Gate, the another
#       to the clock to be counted.
