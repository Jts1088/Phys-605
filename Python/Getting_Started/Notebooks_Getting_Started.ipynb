    "# Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "A relative new feature of Python is the Jupyter Notebook. These notebooks run in your browser. They use a *Markdown*, (see this [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for help) with HTML and LaTex mixed in, to nicely format the text comments, and they use full Python to do computations. There are plugins to do C++ as well, if you insist.\n",
    "\n",
    "This document is itself a Jupyter notebook. You can look at it on GitHub, but if you download it and launch it on your own system, you can make modifications, save them, and run the Python code directly in the notebook. If you don't want to install anything, and don't care about saving your changes, you can pass the GitHub URL to [Binder](mybinder.org) and have a fully interactive notebook (without the save option). Binder is still a bit experimental, but getting better. All the Phys605 notebooks are already available there:[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org:/repo/mholtrop/phys605)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will make use of these notebook in Physics 605, and for some homework and lab reports, this might be a very convenient way for your to submit your work. Either submit the notebook (.ipynb extension) or submit a GitHub URL. \n",
    "For your own use, you can also convert the notebook to a Python script, or an HTML webpage, or you can print it to paper or to pdf. A Jupyter notebook can also be exported to pdf directly if you install [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/installing.html) and LaTex.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "To get started wiht Jupyter Notebooks, you first need to have installed ipython and the jupyter libraries. Fortunately this is already done for you if you installed the Anaconda Python distribution. See [Installing Python]( https://unh.instructure.com/courses/24545/pages/installing-python-on-your-own-system) on MyCources for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to get the notebook server started on you own machine:\n",
    "* You can use the \"Anaconda-Navigator\" and click on \"Launch\" for the Jupyter notebooks. \n",
    "* You can type \"jupyter notebook\", or \"jupyter-notebook\", in a terminal, Powershell, or command window.\n",
    "* \n",
    "Also see: [Jupyter Documentation](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter server will start up on your system, and usually, starts your browser on a page http://localhost:8888 \n"

    "## Entering and running code\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Jupyter notebook you type text into the input box, and if you are done, you type shift+enter to execute that code. The same is true for the Markdown text, type shift+enter and the text is rendered pretty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for a notebook wiht a bunch of Python code in it, you usually need to execute the in[] lines in order, since what was computed before may be needed later in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the top of the notebook document in your browser, you see a standard menu bar. Note the black square for \"interrupt kernel\". That is what you hit if you had some code that takes too long to complete and is now hogging your computer's CPU. The circular arrow allows you to re-launch the kernel, which is a full reset. That means that the in[] fields need to be executed again from the 1st one.\n",
    "\n",
    "You switch the *type* of input, between code, Markdown, Raw, with the selector box next to the arrow. The Markdown input does not a an in[] in front, and usually does not need to be executed again.\n",
    "\n",
    "To re-edit an input that you previously executed, just double click the input box.\n",

You do this so that it knows your code is running inline in the notebook and is not supposed to pop up a window. "
