# UNH Network Setup Scripts

The script in this directory is to be used by UNH owned Raspberry Pis for
Physics 605 only, however, you can easily adapt it for your own needs, see below.
If you don't need a script, then you can follow the directions in the second part
of the PDF file to get your Raspberry Pi setup.

If you need help setting up a Raspberry Pi, please contact the UNH Help Desk
(862-4242) or contact Prof. Maurik Holtrop. 

## For Phys605

You want to run this script on your RPi once it is connected to the 
UNH-Public Wifi. This is a highly simplified script that 
will setup a Raspberry Pi to work on the UNH Secure network. 
You need to run the script with the command

   ```./UNH_Secure_setup.sh```

When the script asks for the number of your Raspberry Pi, 
please give it the number that is on the sticker on your RPi.
