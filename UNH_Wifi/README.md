# UNH Network Setup Scripts

This script is to be used by UNH owned Raspberry Pis only. If you need help setting up an additinal RPi, or your own
RPi, please contact Prof. Maurik Holtrop. 

This is a highly simplified script that will setup a Raspberry Pi to work on the UNH Secure network. You need to run the script with the command

   ```./UNH_Secure_setup.sh```

When the script asks for the number of your Raspberry Pi, please give it the number that is on the sticker on your RPi.
